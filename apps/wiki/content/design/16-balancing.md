title: 16. Balancing
summary: Every formula, every tunable constant, and the pacing model.
section: design
order: 16
---

Every formula and tunable constant is here, with the checks that hold balance in place.

**Source of truth.** The build is normative: every number below is checked against the catalog in
`packages/simulation/src/catalog` at the build this page ships with. [Live tuning](#live-tuning)
names the knobs and why they sit where they do, and [What the checks cover](#what-the-checks-cover)
says what each automated check asserts. Numbers measured from the build are in
[Measurements](/design/measurements).

## Number ranges

Upload Labs players lose interest when numbers become meaningless
([Influences](/design/02-influences#why-players-quit)). Quorum keeps every number in a real range.

| Number    | Range at start | Range at the end of the first company | Hard limit                            |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Users     | 150            | 50 million                            | About 6 billion (online population)   |
| Demand    | 3 rps          | 1 million rps                         | Users × R_user                        |
| Latency   | 30–500 ms      | 30–500 ms                             |                                       |
| Cash      | $300           | Trillions of game dollars             |                                       |
| Valuation |                | About $1 billion at the IPO           | About $100 billion at 6 billion users |

Cash, revenue, and Burn are game dollars. Valuation, payout, and Legacy use real dollars, converted
by the [valuation scale](#valuation-scale).

Formatting: SI suffixes only (k, M, B, T). No letter suffixes such as "aa".

The rollout steps and the certificate's two lifetimes are 05's own. A mesh takes a Cluster's half an engineer of Platform Dev Hours. The pages that own each mechanic give the rate it runs at.

Four rows describe the Features lifecycle: adoption time, lift spread, the upkeep ceiling, and the
market gain cap. Adoption time is exact arithmetic, stepped a Step at a time, so the 63% after a
week is the continuous curve's figure rather than a closed form. The market gain cap holds the
Features' market gains together at +100% of the Era's market.

## Prices

```latex
\begin{aligned}
\text{place price} \left(\text{component} ,\  k\right) &= \text{base price} \left(\text{component}\right) \times 1.25^{k-1} \\
&\quad \text{k = copy number}
\end{aligned}
```

The 1.25 growth on copies is a soft push toward bigger instances and toward better design over more
copies. It is stylized, because real clouds charge the same for the hundredth VM as the first. The
justification is operational overhead, and the card says so. Selling refunds half of what
the last copy cost, at the copy markup.

### Cost index

Request values stay fixed. Prices rise with the Era. Every price in this document is a Garage price,
and the Era's **cost index** multiplies it: placement, Burn, egress, and third-party fees. A separate
**salary index** multiplies engineer salary. Without them, a vCPU costs about 0.1% of the value of the
requests it serves, and Burn never matters.

| Era      | Cost index | Salary index | vCPU ($/s) | Engineer salary ($/s) |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Garage   | 1          | 1            | 0.05       | 0.40                  |
| Pre-seed | 4          | 4            | 0.20       | 1.60                  |
| Seed     | 8          | 8            | 0.40       | 3.20                  |
| Series A | 12         | 12           | 0.60       | 4.80                  |
| Series B | 16         | 16           | 0.80       | 6.40                  |
| Series C | 20         | 20           | 1.00       | 8.00                  |
| Pre-IPO  | 24         | 24           | 1.20       | 9.60                  |
| Public   | 24         | 24           | 1.20       | 9.60                  |

Garage and Pre-seed sit at the floor because there the smallest box, not the traffic, sets the cost.
From Seed the index climbs by 4 points an Era, so infrastructure and payroll grow with the company
while request values stay put. Salary follows the index, and the language factor multiplies on top of
it ([Runtimes](/design/06-runtimes#hiring-and-salaries)). The factors are:

- PHP 0.85.
- Node.js and C# 1.0.
- Python and Java 1.05.
- Ruby 1.1.
- Go 1.15.
- Elixir 1.2.
- Rust and Zig 1.25.
- Haskell 1.4.

[Live tuning](#live-tuning) records how far these values sit from the design's.

A Balanced design should land at a margin of 25% to 45%, which puts the Rule of 40 checklist item
within reach but not free. `pacing.test.ts` records the margin at Seed and Series A entry.

### Valuation scale

Game revenue is stylized: 50 million users at 0.02 rps send 1 million rps, and the average request
is worth about $1 to $3. A year of that revenue is about $500 billion. A real company of that size
reports an ARR near $77 million. The valuation scale, 1.5 × 10⁻⁴, converts a year of game revenue into
that real ARR. At the IPO, a Rule of 40 multiple of 13 gives a Valuation of about $1 billion. At 6
billion users the Valuation is about $100 billion.

## Vertical and horizontal

A size step doubles vCPU, RAM, and Burn. Price is linear in resources, as in real clouds, so price per
vCPU does not decide between one big box and many small ones. These tradeoffs do:

| One big box                                                                                    | Many small boxes                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| No load balancer, no network hop                                                               | Redundancy: one failure loses a fraction                   |
| One runtime base memory instead of many                                                        | Fine-grained scaling: add 10%, not 100%                    |
| Runtimes that cannot use more cores waste the size (Node.js on one loop, a pool at one worker) | Needs a load balancer and more connections to the database |
| Resize means a restart                                                                         | Rolling changes                                            |
| Hard cap at `metal` (96 vCPU)                                                                  | Each copy costs 25% more to place                          |

## User growth

```latex
\text{growth} = g \left(\text{Era}\right) \times \text{Users} \times \left(1 - \text{Users} / \text{Market}\right) \times h \left(A\right)
```

| Era      | `g` (per sim second) | Time to the milestone at Apdex 1.0 with no capacity limit |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Garage   | 0.0040               | 12 minutes, from 150 to 1,000                             |
| Pre-seed | 0.0022               | 21 minutes, from 1,000 to 5,000                           |
| Seed     | 0.0016               | 28 minutes, from 5,000 to 25,000                          |
| Series A | 0.0009               | 56 minutes, from 25,000 to 150,000                        |
| Series B | 0.0007               | 1 hour 12 minutes, from 150,000 to 1 million              |
| Series C | 0.0005               | 1 hour 56 minutes, from 1 million to 10 million           |
| Pre-IPO  | 0.0003               | 2 hours 30 minutes, from 10 million to 50 million         |
| Public   | 0.0002               |                                                           |

The times solve the logistic equation from the Era's start to its milestone with the market sizes in
[Progression](/design/10-progression#eras): `t = ln(((M − U₀) / U₀) × (U₁ / (M − U₁))) / g`. The sum is
about 7 hours 36 minutes.

From Series C the formula runs per region ([Simulation](/design/04-simulation#users-and-growth)). With
`seed_share` at 0.05, a Company that reaches Series C with 1,000,000 users starts Europe at 37,500,
Asia-Pacific at 25,000, and South America at 12,500. Far demand is then about 7% of the total, not
60%, so a single-region Design meets the round trip as a warning, not as a collapse. North America's
market alone is 5.6 million, so the 10 million Milestone needs users abroad. The table above assumes
one region and the Era's full market.

Churn is steep on purpose, and much steeper than in real life. Brutlag (2009) found that 400 ms of
extra latency cost Google 0.59% of searches over six weeks; the game compresses weeks into minutes.
Fickle users carry the steepness: at the Series C target of 0.92, an Apdex of 0.91 loses them at
about 3% per calendar hour. Steady users leave at a fifth of that. Three calendar days at 0.909
take a region of 1,000,000 users, half of them steady, to about 360,000, not 93,000 as with one rate.
The [Churn breakdown](/design/12-observability#the-churn-breakdown) shows the rate.

Word of mouth crosses borders at `m` = 0.1. With 1,000,000 users at home, a region abroad grows as
if it had 100,000 users of its own on top of its seed, so it fills fast once its users are served
well, and it recovers after it lost its users.

Brutlag also found that searches stayed low for a while after the delay was removed. The game does
not model that lag: users respond to the last calendar hour only, so a fix shows its effect within
the hour. A lag would hide the feedback the Churn breakdown exists to give.

These are lower bounds. Capacity, Cash, and research make a real player slower, while Features raise
`g` and the market, which makes growth faster still.

Growth alone sets the length of the first two Eras. At `g` × 1 the Garage takes 12 sim minutes to go
from 150 to 1,000 users and Pre-seed 21 more to 5,000, so Seed arrives at about 33 sim minutes
whatever the Design does. At the Company pace, where `g` is doubled, the same growth takes half as
long.

## Pacing model

The pacing model is a set of scripted players that run against the real simulation in tests, so a
balance change shows up as a test failure rather than in a playtest report. Every bot leaves the
Team's autopilot on, and every bot but Greedy hires while payroll, the new hire included, stays under
25% of revenue, up to 4 engineers.

| Bot      | Strategy                                                                                     | Design limit                                       | Check                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Balanced | Relieves the bottleneck Node, researches by a fixed priority list, builds each Era's content | Inside the targets                                 | Seeds 1–5: Seed reached on every seed at 26.8–35.7 sim minutes, Pre-seed within 20 min, positive Garage and Pre-seed margins |
| Greedy   | Bigger boxes and the cheapest research; never hires                                          | Not beat a target by more than 40%                 | Seeds 1–3: Seed no faster than 27 minutes                                                                                    |
| Stubborn | Never changes the starting Stack                                                             | Reach IPO within 1.6× the target time              | Seeds 1–3: Seed within 1.6× Balanced on the same seed                                                                        |
| Polyglot | Migrates to every language it researches                                                     | Not beat Balanced by more than 30%                 | Seeds 1–3: Seed no faster than 0.7× Balanced                                                                                 |
| Decliner | Plays Balanced and declines every funding round                                              | Legacy per hour not beat Balanced by more than 15% | Seeds 1–3: reaches Seed with Equity at 100%                                                                                  |
| Idle     | Plays Balanced, but logs in every 2 hours, spends everything, and leaves                     | Reach Pre-seed within 24 hours of game time        | `bots.test.ts` (`SLOW_TESTS=1`)                                                                                              |
| Margin   | Plays like Balanced and records margin at each Era milestone                                 | Margin in 25% to 45% from Seed on                  | `pacing.test.ts` records the margin at Seed and Series A entry                                                               |

A balance change passes when the bots meet their limits on seeds 1–5: Balanced runs on all five
seeds, the others on seeds 1–3 (`pacing.test.ts` and `bots.test.ts`, both under `SLOW_TESTS=1`).

## Dominance

Pillar 2 says no option strictly dominates another. `dominance.test.ts` runs in every `pnpm test` and in
CI. Within each language, every runtime must beat each of its siblings by at least 10% on one
reference score:

- Throughput on the real Ledger of a Pre-seed Design.
- RAM per process.
- Realtime connections per GB.
- Startup.
- Cold speed.
- Stall-free CPU work.
- GC pause.
- Leak-proof processes.
- A self-sized pool.
- One of the six axes of its profile.

Each language's frameworks follow the same rule: no framework is at least as good as a sibling on
every score (CPU, memory, velocity, coordination, debt, background hours, per-kind CPU and value,
startup, ORM, cacheability, native build, and the six axes) and better on one.

Across languages, BEAM holds the most realtime connections per GB, beating Go and Kestrel. The
option sets are the 28 runtimes, each language's frameworks, the instance families (Burstable,
General, Compute, Memory), and the PHP-FPM pool modes. Axum and Actix are within about 5% of each
other on CPU and velocity, and ARM runs at 0.8× the price and 0.95× the CPU, so a CPU-millisecond on
ARM costs 0.84× General's. The fix for a dominated option is to change the option, not to tweak a
number.

## Runtime balance targets

`balance.test.ts` asserts these comparisons on the real Ledger of a Pre-seed Design:

| Check                                                | Target                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Java cold against warm throughput                    | 30% at start, 100% after 30 s |
| Rust against Go, server cost for the same load       | 25% to 40% lower              |
| Rust against Go, Dev Hours for the same feature set  | 50% to 70% higher             |
| Elixir against Node.js, `rt` connections per GB      | 3× to 5×                      |

Under a PHP-FPM Design with OPcache, Node.js cluster mode answers `read` at 1.5× to 2.5× the throughput per
dollar, and 3× to 6× with a database at 100 ms. A single Node.js process with 5% `login` adds 40 to
120 ms to p99.

## Prestige curve

```latex
\text{legacy} = \operatorname{floor}\left(\sqrt{\text{payout} / \$1{,}000{,}000}\right)
```

| Company | Expected payout | Legacy | Cumulative | Shop progress (1,766 ★)           |
| ------- | --------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1       | $500 million    | 22     | 22         | 1%                                |
| 2       | $1.5 billion    | 38     | 60         | 3%                                |
| 3       | $5 billion      | 70     | 130        | 7%                                |
| 5       | $20 billion     | 141    | 371        | 21%                               |
| 8       | $50 billion     | 223    | 967        | 55%                               |
| 9       | $80 billion     | 282    | 1,249      | 71%                               |
| 12      | $200 billion    | 447    | 2,442      | the whole shop, and a third again |

The twelve perks of [the Legacy shop](/design/13-prestige#the-legacy-shop) cost 1,766 ★ in all. The
cumulative column follows payouts of $500 million, $1.5, $5, $10, $20, $30, $40, $50, $80, $120,
$160, and $200 billion for companies 1 to 12, so the shop is complete around the eleventh company.

Payout is Equity × Valuation × the Exit's multiplier, so the rounds set it
([Economy](/design/09-economy#funding)):

- 10% at 1,000 users.
- 19% at 5,000 and 25,000.
- 13% at 150,000.
- 12% at 1,000,000 and 10,000,000.
- 15% sold in the IPO offering.

## Live tuning

The pacing knobs live in `catalog/tuning.ts`, and the cost and salary indexes in each Era
(`EraDef.costIndex` and `EraDef.salaryIndex`). Two tunings read them:

- **A Company** plays at `LIVE_TUNING`: growth × 2, an incident every 400 sim seconds, and the first
  90 seconds after the Pre-seed raise.
- **A Challenge and a Sandbox** replay at `CHALLENGE_TUNING`: growth × 1, an incident every 720
  seconds, and the first after 600. The pacing bots use it too, so a run shows a whole curve inside
  a test.

Both share the calendar pace, so a calendar day lasts 60 sim seconds. The `tuning` parameter of
`step`, `growthOf`, `directIncidents`, `raise`, and `decline` selects one.

| Knob           | Challenge pace                     | Company pace                      | Why they differ                                                                                                 | Constant                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Growth pace    | `g` × 1                            | `g` × 2                           | A session of 15 to 30 minutes needs the faster rate; a replay keeps the slower one so a whole curve fits a test | `CHALLENGE_TUNING`, `LIVE_TUNING` (`PLAYTEST_PACE`) |
| Incident gap   | 720 sim s mean (12 minutes)        | 400 sim s mean                    | A replay spreads incidents across the curve; a session has to meet several                                      | `INCIDENT_GAP`                                      |
| First incident | 600 sim s after the Pre-seed raise | 90 sim s after the Pre-seed raise | A session meets an incident early; a replay does not need to                                                    | `FIRST_INCIDENT_AFTER`                              |
| Calendar pace  | 60 sim s a day                     | 60 sim s a day                    | One value for both: a hire and a deploy have to fit inside a session                                            | `CALENDAR_PACE`                                     |

The cost index, the salary index, and the speeds are one value each, set per Era or per perk rather
than per tuning:

| Knob           | Value                                                      | Why                                                                               | Constant                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Cost index     | 1 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 24                         | Rises with the Era so Burn stays a real share of revenue at every size of company | `EraDef.costIndex`          |
| Salary index   | follows the cost index: 1 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 24 | Payroll has to stay a real share of Burn at the prices the player pays            | `EraDef.salaryIndex`        |
| Company speeds | 0.5×, 1×, 3×, 10×; 20× and 40× with Time dilation          | A slower speed for watching a Design settle, faster ones for the late Eras        | `SPEEDS`, `DILATION_SPEEDS` |

## What the checks cover

- `pacing.test.ts`, `bots.test.ts` and `legacy-pacing.test.ts` play the bots against the real
  Simulation; the slower ones run under `SLOW_TESTS=1` and CI does not set it.
- `balance.test.ts` asserts the runtime targets above and runs in `pnpm test`.
- `digests.test.ts` and `breadth.test.ts` assert determinism, finite numbers and save round trips
  across the whole catalog.
- The bridge and the shutdown fire at the numbers in [Economy](/design/09-economy); no bot plays a
  Company into a shortfall.
